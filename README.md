Building a Character Level language model all the way from Simple Bigram 
model to Transformers, which can predict unique names if fed with names.

Dataset is names.txt while containing around 32000 unique names. Below is 
list of implementation for that:

-> Simple Bigram model (next character prediction Based on probability and look up table)

-> MLP, following Bengio et al. 2003

-> CNN, following DeepMind WaveNet 2016 paper

-> RNN, following Mikolov et al. 2010 paper

-> LSTM, following Graves et al. 2014

-> GRU, following Kyunghyun Cho et al. 2014

-> Transformer, following Vaswani et al. 2017
